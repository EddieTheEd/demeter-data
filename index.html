    <h1>Demeter Data</h1>
    <p>Hello! This is where <a href="https://demeter.toomwn.xyz/">Demeter's</a> data is stored. I'm guessing you got here by opening a pdf, and wondering what the 'demeter-data.netlify.app' domain was all about. Well, this is it! This website is hosted separately to the main Demeter website (different Github repository, different hosting services). While the main website uses Vercel, this one uses Netlify, because Netlify doesn't complain about repository size >:(</p>
    <p>Anyways, there's nothing much to do back here. Why don't you go back? :)</p>
