Some pieces of advice for searching up your text:
1. The words "the" and "a" are ignored when categorising the files in alphabetical order
e.g., The text "The Lazy Dog" and "A Lazy Dog" would be in the folder called "L".
2. Symbols such as exclamation marks, commas, quotation marks, hyphens, colons, semicolons, etc are ignored in the file names.
e.g., The text "My Dad's Dog: A Lazy, Random-Word-With-Hyphens Dog" would be named "Litcharts-My-Dads-Dog-A-Lazy-Random-Word-With-Hyphens-Dog.pdf".
3. There may be other stuff that you need to figure out, so be prepared to spend a bit of time searching through the folders and experimenting to find your text using trial and error.
