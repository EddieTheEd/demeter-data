Composition: The arrangement of elements within the image. People are overshadowed by the butterflies and city.
They're even as big as the buildings, creating a sense of how large the mass of butterflies is.

Perspective: Wide, high perspective (not wide shot from high camera angle). This has the effect of showing that
humans are insignificant compared to nature, creating a sense of the smallness of people; the reality that as
people we're very small compared to nature. We only see blurred outlines of people, creating a sense of people
unified as a society yet quite small compared to the event.
